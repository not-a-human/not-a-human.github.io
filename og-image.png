# This is a placeholder for the Open Graph image
# You should replace this with an actual 1200x630 PNG image
# that represents your portfolio for social media sharing.
# 
# The image should include:
# - Your name "Avie Sinar"
# - Title "Full-Stack Developer"
# - Your brand colors (cyan theme)
# - Professional background
# 
# For now, copy your existing icon.png and resize it to 1200x630
# or use a design tool like Canva, Figma, or Photoshop to create
# a proper social media preview image.
